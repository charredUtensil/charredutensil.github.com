                    employers and have written
                    Ruby code for all kinds of
                    applications, including one
                    designed to automate the
                    scanning of paper forms with
                    OCR, a simplified admin and
                    permissions wrapper for

                    image boards, a puzzle game
                    inspired by the work of
                    Charles Babbage, the GLOBOL

                    scripts here and there to
                    automate menial tasks. I can
                    say without a doubt that it
                    has become my favorite

                    I picked up Python in a week
                    and loved it from the start.
                    I played with it long enough
                    to write a few cool projects,
                    including a program to edit
                    programs for the TI84 on the
                    PC, and an automated music
                    generator I nicknamed
                    Pythoven. Later, I ended up
                    working on a pair of Django
                    apps, one of which is a complex
                    web store, integrating with
                    a multitude of API to print
                    and sell custom notebooks.

                    In learning Scheme, I learned
                    quite a bit about functional
                    programming. Just about any
                    single function I can think of
                    in any other language I can code
                    in Scheme, but the most complex
                    project I've ever attempted was
                    an interpreter for a slightly
                    different Lisp-like language.

                    The very concept of a language
                    where it is possible to define
                    a list of every prime number
                    and lazily compute finite subsets
                    of it amuses me to no end. I've
                    forgotten much of the syntax
                    over the years, but the
                    concepts have remained and
                    tend to find their way into my
                    daily programming habits where
                    they are useful.

                    which would become the inspiration
                    for a later esoteric programming
                    language, although most of them
                    ran very slowly as I had yet to
                    learn about algorithmic efficiency.
                    It has been a while, but I can
                    still understand Visual Basic

                    some more if I ever put a few

                    scratch myself was a website where students
                    could upload print jobs to the server,
                    select any printer on campus, click a
                    button, be billed the $0.05, then have the
                    pages appear in the selected printer. At
                    another employer, I converted a 50KLOC
                    internal use app from Ruby 1.8/Rails 2 to
                    Ruby 1.9/Rails 3, in the process stripping
                    away almost a fifth of the app's code and
                    noticably decreasing its response time.
